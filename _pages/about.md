My research interests span the areas of network systems and distributed systems, particularly in cloud & edge computing, and distributed data-intensive systems. 

I completed my computer science Master’s degree at [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc), advised by Professor [SuKyoung Lee](http://winet.yonsei.ac.kr/home/). 
I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Electronics & Information Engineering from [Hansung University](https://hansung.ac.kr/eng/index.do) in 2019 with a minor in Computer Engineering, advised by Professor. Kitae Hwang. 
Currently, I am working as a researcher at Korea Electronics Technology Institute([KETI](https://www.keti.re.kr/eng/main/main.php)).
