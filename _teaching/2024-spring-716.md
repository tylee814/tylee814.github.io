## Overview

IoT represents a paradigm shift in computing, aiming to bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds. Its development has opened up new possibilities, including mobile health, smart homes, industrial automation, and more. Throughout the course, students will delve into advanced topics such as IoT networking, mobile and edge computing, embedded machine learning, wireless sensing, human-computer interaction, and mobile health applications. To excel in this course, students are expected to engage in pre-class readings, active in-class participation, and complete a semester-long project. The focus of the course will be on training research philosophy and principle instead of paper’s technical detail. 

<!--
## Target Audience

The intended audience of this course is PhD students or masters students who are interested in pursuing a PhD in the future. As a research-oriented class, it's designed to bring people up to speed on the history as well as the state of the art in mobile computing and to gain experience with the design, early implementation, and evaluation of a research idea. The course covers multiple disciplines and encourage interdisciplinary projects, students with diverse backgrounds such as computer science/engineering, electrical engineering, biomedical engineering or other related areas are welcomed.
-->

<!--
### Prerequisites

Experience equivalent of an undergraduate degree in any of Electrical
Engineering, Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Data Science, Information
Science, or related areas.  This is a vertical slice through the computing
stack, and we will touch on topics from programming languages and distributed
systems down to circuits and wireless. An enthusiasm and willingness to learn a
little about a lot of new things is far more important than any one specific
background.

The goal is to have a fairly diverse course with folks from different and
complimentary backgrounds. We'll cover topics in each of these areas, but you
are **not** expected to be familiar with all of them.

If you are comfortable with **just one** of these, and are interested in
learning a little about the rest, welcome!

 - Operating Systems
 - Programming Languages (especially systems-oriented ones)
 - Networking
 - Wireless Communication
 - Architecture
-->

## Syllabus

This class is made of three components: pre-class reviews, in-class participation, and a quarter-long project.

### Paper reviews

Before each class you must read two papers and then write a short review. 

#### 1 Review Submission

We will use the [HotCRP review system](https://jhu-adviot24.hotcrp.com/) &ndash; the same tool used by many conferences to review papers.
We will create accounts for all enrolled students during the first week of classes.
If you need an account or have other issues, please
<a href="mailto:rjzhao@jhu.edu?subject=CS716-adviot24%20HotCRP%20Issue">e-mail me</a>.

The review form is following the conferences in the field of computer networks and mobile computing. (Except the Reviewer expertise is replaced by Writing quality)

#### 2 Guides

The review should be more than a simple summary of the paper. Here are some questions to consider while reading and writing your reviews to help guide you:

What is the problem this paper addresses, and why is it important?  
What is the main contribution of the paper? New research direction? Novel techniques? Solid system design?  
What is the hypothesis of this paper?  
How was the paper evaluated? What supported it, what refuted it?  
What are the limits of this system (when does it fail)?  
What is this most similar to that you are already familiar with; how does it compare, differ?  
At what point did you decide you liked – or didn't like – the paper, why?  

Since the papers covers a lot of different fields, you are not required to dig into every corner and totally understand every technical details. (No one is able to be an expert of all fields). You can go though the paper and focused on thinking the guiding questions.

#### 3 Grading (40%)

No need to concern about the grading as long as you contribute enough efforts to the course.
Every completed enough review counts 2 points. The lead is responsible to review the reviews and mark any missed or need improvement ones. Please use this sheet (TBD).  

<!-- There are 23 required reviews in total. You have some flexibility on choosing to skip some topics or miss some deadline. But still make sure at least you read the paper before the course otherwise it will be a waste of your time. -->

### Participation

We will rotate through class members to lead discussion each session. Leads
should be prepared to give an overview of the paper's key ideas and to guide a
discussion about the strengths and weaknesses of the paper, how it relates to
prior and/or subsequent work, and what the core takeaway(s) of the paper may
be.

When not the lead, everyone else is expected to have read the papers and to
actively participate in the class discussions.

The last 15 mins will be used for elevator pitch of the group projects.

#### 1 Discussion Lead

Each paper has roughly 30 minutes of class time. For discussions, this should
generally allow for a 5 minute introduction followed by 25 minutes of
discussion.

When you are leading discussion, you have three primary responsibilities like a typical paper review lead:

 1. Prepare a summary presentation of the paper. This summary should be
 reasonably polished / prepared in advance. The summary should recount
 the major concepts introduced in the paper, give an overview of the core
 technical details, and crisply identify any hypotheses presented in the
 work, how they were evaluated, and any conclusions that can be drawn.

 2. Prepare and share a summary others' paper reviews. Try to first identify
 any points of confusion or desired clarifications, so that we can start the
 discussion by getting everyone up to speed. Then propose (at least) three
 topics of discussion from the paper. Try to include (at least) one that looks
 at the paper's strengths, one that looks at potential weaknesses, and one that
 looks beyond the ideas directly discussed in the paper. **Share this summary
 and discussion prompts in the class slack before the start of class.**

 3. Lead discussion! Start with your summary presentation, then any remaining
 clarifications, and then the more open-ended discussion segment. (Raise some questions for discussion.)

_When you are discussion lead, you do **not** need to submit reviews._

#### 2 Grading (20%)

10% for discussion lead and presentation.

10% for course participation. Checked by name tag. Ask for leave through email if you have reasonable excuse.


#### 3 Project Elevator Pitch

In order to provide timely feedbacks on the projects during the whole semester, elevator pitch is introduced for project updates. The elevator pitch presentations are not needed to be well constructed. You can just briefly discuss what you have done recently.

There will be two pitches per course and every talk will take 5 mins. Stop watch will be used to notify the presenter. The arrangement will be flexible according to the time left after two main discussions.

### Class Project

This class will feature a quarter long project of your own choosing.

There are different kinds of choices:

1. Research project: Project scope should be commensurate with group size &ndash; an individual project is acceptable, though advised against. A core goal of the project is to demonstrate mastery of the scientific method: namely to clearly articulate a hypothesis and to design and implement experiments that (in)validate the hypothesis (note: a project with a negative result may still be a highly successful project!). The goal of the project is to learn how to propose a research idea, to then collect preliminary data to probe the viability of that idea, and finally to practice communicating this process in writing.

2. Reproduce and explore. If you do not have a specific project in mind, a good starting point might be picking some impactful papers (Best papers, most cited papers or test of time awarded papers). Reproduce the classic or already succeed projects and explore new directions. I will support some projects which aligns my interest.  

<!-- 3. Survey and dig the history. If you think any topic discussed in the course does not cover the most representative papers.  -->


You can reuse your own research project for the class project (as long as you can convince me it is related to the course topic). Please do notify us if you do so and the guidance and expectation will be adjusted accordingly.



<!--
[Here is a document with some project ideas to help seed your thinking](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15h5vPUihu9CUCWGk2JJQc-RQrHcaaIg2vlySRe1Hui8/edit).

The project will have three milestones:

<dl>
  <dt>Week 3</dt>
  <dd>Monday, April 12: One to two page proposal writeup that includes your hypothesis, motivation, and at least one experiment you intend to run.</dd>
  <dt>Week 6</dt>
  <dd>Monday, May 3: Three to four page draft that includes a literature review ("Related Work"), proposed experiments, and their expected outcomes.</dd>
  <dt>Week 10</dt>
  <dd>Tuesday, June 1: Final five to six page paper that includes outcome of small-scale experiments / prototype / etc. This should resemble an early-to-mature draft of an academic workshop paper.</dd>
</dl>

            <li>Leading: Missing summary and context (ed: weakness of no slides); discussion topics less set. <strong>Action:</strong> Pending discussion in class: Leads no longer required to write reviews; instead, use time to write explicit 3~5 minute summary; post meta-review and discussion seeds to slack before class starts.</li>
            <li>Hybrid: Mixed experience; much improved with new A/V setup; hard to consistently interact. <strong>Action:</strong> Pat &amp; Nishant will more actively watch Zoom, use hand raise or chat, and invite comments in middle as well as end.</li>
            <li>Moderation: Ensure balance across speakers; promote less speaking folks more; consider cutting off less relevant tangents. <strong>Action:</strong> Discuss interaction techniques in class; explicit tracking by Pat for a bit.</li>
